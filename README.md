# Examining the Impact of Health Indicators, Socioeconomic Factors, and Education on Global Life Expectancy

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the factors influencing global life expectancy using data from the WHO's Global Health Observatory (2000-2015). Using statistical techniques, including linear regression modeling, we identify key health, socioeconomic, and educational factors that significantly impact life expectancy across 193 countries.

## Institution  
**Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, Indiana University**  
**INFO-B18: Applied Statistics in Biomedical Informatics**  

## Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)  
- **Variables**: Life expectancy, mortality rates, immunization coverage, GDP, schooling, and more  

## Research Questions  
1. What are the primary health indicators and socioeconomic factors influencing life expectancy?  
2. How does education impact life expectancy when controlling for economic and health factors?  

## Methodology  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized variable distributions and correlations  
- **Modeling**: Multi-variable linear regression with stepwise selection  
- **Diagnostics**: Residual analysis, histograms, and QQ plots  

## Key Findings  
- Socioeconomic status, education, and healthcare access strongly influence life expectancy  
- Higher schooling levels positively correlate with increased life expectancy  
- Health indicators such as adult mortality and HIV/AIDS prevalence have significant negative effects
